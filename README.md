## PlayAudioWidget
Display play/pause buttons and play WAV or MP3 audio from a file stored 
in System.FileDocument or a specialization of it.

Different browsers play different media types. WAV, MP3, and MP4 containers 
are widely supported (PCM, MP3, and AAC formats, respectively). Other 
containers like ADTS, Ogg, WebM, and FLAC may be supported (AAC, Vorbis, 
Opus, and FLAC formats).

See [HTML5 Audio - Supported audio coding formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_audio#Supported_audio_coding_formats) 
for browser support.
